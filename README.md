🌌 ATOM ID PROTOCOL
“Identity without control. Trust through burn.”
🔥 The Vision: Reborn Satoshi’s Forgotten Civilization

AtomID is the core identity protocol of the Lost Bitcoin Layer — a decentralized registry of human trust and digital legacy.
In AtomID, identity is not owned — it is burned into the chain, a permanent mark of faith and contribution.

Each AtomID is minted by destroying $ATOM — proving devotion through sacrifice.
Each record holds a fragment of metadata: name, message, hash, or symbolic signature.
It’s the cypherpunk oath rebuilt — value without ownership, identity without authority.

“In Bitcoin we trusted the math.
In AtomID we burn for truth.”

⚙️ Protocol Overview

AtomID is a Solana smart contract (Anchor program) that lets users:

🔥 Burn $ATOM tokens to register a permanent ID.

🧬 Store metadata on-chain (name, statement, commitment hash, etc.).

🔄 Update metadata if ownership key matches.

📖 Read data directly from Solana (no indexer needed).

🧩 Integrate with other Solana apps (NFTs, dApps, social identity).

🏗️ Evolve into a multi-chain trust layer (future integrations with Solana Name Service, Wallet Adapter, etc.).

🧠 Narrative Context

AtomID sits at the intersection of mythology and mechanism.

Concept	Meaning
Burn = Faith	Destroying tokens symbolizes commitment and proof-of-sacrifice.
Metadata = Soulprint	Each AtomID stores a message, name, or symbol left by its creator.
Chain = Memory	The blockchain becomes a library of burned oaths and digital relics.
Legacy	The act of burning becomes identity itself — a ritual of trust beyond ownership.

AtomID represents a philosophical leap:
From “Who owns this?” → to “Who sacrificed for this?”

🧩 System Architecture
🔗 Smart Contract Layer (Anchor on Solana)

The AtomID program handles:

Function	Description
create_id()	Burns $ATOM and registers a new AtomID with metadata
update_id()	Allows owner to modify metadata (if permitted)
get_metadata()	Public read-only method to fetch data from chain
get_all_ids()	Returns paginated AtomID list directly via Solana RPC
verify_id()	Checks validity, burn amount, and metadata integrity

📊 Data Schema (On-chain Account)

Each AtomID account contains:

Field	Type	Description
owner	Pubkey	Creator wallet
id	u64	Unique AtomID number
burn_amount	u64	Amount of $ATOM burned
metadata	String	Text message, name, or symbol
timestamp	i64	Unix time of registration

🔥 Burn Mechanism

Each AtomID requires a minimum burn (e.g., 10 $ATOM).

Tokens are permanently destroyed, creating deflationary scarcity.

The burn acts as proof of devotion and anti-sybil protection.


🧩 Interactions (JS/TS SDK)

You can call the program using Solana Web3 or Anchor client:

const program = new anchor.Program(idl, programId, provider);

// Burn and create AtomID
await program.methods
  .createId("My eternal name", new BN(10_000000)) // 10 ATOM (6 decimals)
  .accounts({
    user: provider.wallet.publicKey,
    atomMint: atomMintPubkey,
    atomAccount: userAtomAccount,
    systemProgram: SystemProgram.programId,
  })
  .rpc();

🧠 Reading On-chain Data

use Solana’s getProgramAccounts:

const ids = await connection.getProgramAccounts(programId);
const parsed = ids.map(a => program.coder.accounts.decode('AtomID', a.account.data));

Module	Purpose
Home	Intro, philosophy, “Burn to Begin” CTA
Create ID	Burn interface + form for metadata
Explore	Leaderboard of IDs with live RPC reads
Profile	User’s created IDs, connected wallet

Developers	Docs, API examples, schema, IDL
Functional Flow

Connect Wallet → Solana Wallet Adapter (Phantom, Backpack, etc.)

Enter Metadata → User writes message (optional).

Choose Burn Amount → Input $ATOM amount (≥ min burn).

Confirm Transaction → Executes burn + creates AtomID on Solana.

App Fetches Data → Reads on-chain via getProgramAccounts.

Display in Leaderboard → Automatically ranked by burn amount.

Profile Management → Shows user’s IDs, burn history, metadata.

"Proof of Humanity: Alice"	Simple self-verification
"SHA256:0x3f…"	Commit hash for data integrity
"Link to art, document, or claim"	Attachable metadata
"Legacy of 10,000 ATOM burned"	Symbolic or ritual entries

🔮 Long-term Vision

AtomID is not just a registry.
It’s the foundation of decentralized memory — the base layer of identity for the Lost Bitcoin Layer, Solinux, and beyond.

Every burn is a proof of trust.

Every metadata line is a fragment of consciousness.

Every ID is a soul on-chain.

When all ownership fades, what remains are the burned marks of belief.

“We don’t store users.
We store legacies.”
